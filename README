Emperor
=======

An orthodox file manager for the GNOME desktop.

Installation
------------

To build Emperor from source, you will need:

 * A working C compiler, make, and a bourne-compatible /bin/sh
 * GTK+3 and dependencies
 * libxml2
 * Gee, the Vala collections library, version 0.7.0 or newer.

Configure the package with `./configure', build with `make', and install
with `make install` (usually as root). Type `./configure --help' for a 
full list of configuration options. See the file `INSTALL' for details.

If you wish to build Emperor without libnotify support, either because your
system does not have libnotify version 0.7, or because you wish to disable
it, you will need also the Vala compiler.

To run Emperor from the source tree without installing, use `make run'.

To bootstrap, e.g. if you got the source with git, you will also need:

 * Vala (version 0.12 or newer is supported)
 * GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool
 * Python 3.x, with "python3" in your PATH

To generate the `./configure' script from a git clone, run `./bootstrap.sh'
